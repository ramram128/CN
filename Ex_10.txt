Steps to Simulate the Program in Keil uVision
Set up Keil uVision:

Open Keil uVision and create a new project.
Select the 8051 microcontroller as the target device (e.g., AT89C51).
Write the Program:

Create a new .asm file and paste the assembly code into it.
Build the Project:

Click on the Build button to assemble the program. Make sure there are no errors.
Simulate the Program:

After building the project, click on the Start/Stop Debug Session button to begin the simulation.
You can check the register values (e.g., R0, R1, R2, R3, R4) to verify the results of the arithmetic operations


code....


ORG 0H            ; Starting point of the program

MOV A, #20        ; Load the value 20 into register A (Accumulator)
MOV B, #10        ; Load the value 10 into register B

; --- Addition ---
ADD AB            ; A = A + B (20 + 10 = 30)
MOV R0, A         ; Store the result of addition in register R0

; --- Subtraction ---
MOV A, #20        ; Reload A with value 20 for subtraction
SUBB A, B         ; A = A - B (20 - 10 = 10)
MOV R1, A         ; Store the result of subtraction in register R1

; --- Multiplication ---
MOV A, #5         ; Load the value 5 into register A
MOV B, #4         ; Load the value 4 into register B
MUL AB            ; Multiply A and B (5 * 4 = 20)
MOV R2, A         ; Store the result of multiplication in register R2

; --- Division ---
MOV A, #20        ; Load the value 20 into register A
MOV B, #4         ; Load the value 4 into register B
DIV AB            ; Divide A by B (20 / 4 = 5)
MOV R3, A         ; Store the quotient in register R3
MOV R4, B         ; Store the remainder in register R4

; --- Infinite Loop ---
HERE:
SJMP HERE         ; Jump to HERE (infinite loop to keep the program running)

END               ; End of the program
